# EE2361FinalProject
The API for our project will be a microphone (specifically the electret microphone amplifier). The microcontroller will read in this input and parse the information. Based on the input that the microphone provides the controller we will turn on LED strips and RGB iLEDs. The LED stips and RGB iLEDs will then “dance” according to the music.
